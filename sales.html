			<p class="info">Working under the direction of a District Sales Manager, you will be responsible for:
			</p>
				<ul class="job-responsibilities">
					<li>Servicing an existing customer base on a weekly or bi-weekly basis</li>
					<li>Developing new customer relations through on-going personal contact</li>
					<li>Providing product information and training to customers as required</li>
					<li>Working with customers to grow their businesses</li>
				</ul>

			<p class="info">While we are a distribution company, our philosophy goes beyond the typical distributor. Our motto is <i>"Trust The Difference"</i> and you immediately see that we are different. We want to build long term relations with our customers and that requires an exceptionally high level of customer service.
			Our reputation is unequalled. Our product lines are extensive. Our customer service is exceptional. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If you have a strong drive to provide an exceptional customer experience, a willingness to do what is necessary to keep our customers happy, and a desire to learn, then we want to talk with you. But, you should note â€“ this is a sales position. While you will start with a group of current customers, you will excel if you are able to open new doors through prospecting, cold calling and general hard work. Your rewards will be directly related to your efforts!</p><br>
